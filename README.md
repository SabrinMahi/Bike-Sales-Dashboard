# Bike-Sales-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, Creating Multiple dashboards and tables to Analyze the data. This process involved  several stages , including data preprocessing, data cleaning, data visualization.

**Possible Questions from the Dashboard:**
1. Average Income per Purchase

Which gender has a higher average income for bike purchases?

What is the difference in average income between those who purchased and did not purchase bikes?

How does gender influence bike purchasing behavior?

2. Customer Age Brackets

Which age group buys the most bikes?

How does bike purchase vary between adolescents, middle-aged, and older customers?

Is there a significant drop in bike purchases for older customers?

3. Customer Commute Distance

Which commute distance group purchases the most bikes?

How does bike purchasing trend change with commute distance?

Do shorter commute distances have higher bike purchases compared to longer distances?

** Demographic Filters (Slicers)

Does marital status affect bike purchasing trends?

Which education level shows the highest bike purchases?

Which region has the highest bike purchases?

***General Analysis

What patterns can be observed when filtering by marital status, education, and region?

How can this dashboard be used to target marketing campaigns?

What recommendations can be made based on the dashboard insights?

**Process**
Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.

Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format, and values used.

Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.

Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.
